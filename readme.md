# A2 Genetic Algorithms

Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming.

Group Members: N/A

Any peers and/or TAs/Tutors you collaborated with:

Tabitha (classmate);
Tanya Chen (TA)

Would you like to give "kudos" to anyone who was particularly supportive or helpful?

If you used AI, please describe how you used it and what the experience taught you:

I consulted AI to explored random() further especially the concepts of its bounds which I realized I had been confusing for a long time. This experience required close inspection on my part because AI gave me some slightly sidetracked explanation which didn't really match with some of the things I knew were correct.

## Questions

Please briefly describe what you observed about the "winners" produced by your genetic algorithm. Did changing the parameter values have any effect on what you observed?

When I run trials, I noticed that the mutation rate was correlating to the length of the chromosomes of the final best fit elements. The rounds that started with a higher value of m, mutation rate ended with shorter chromosome while the ones that had a smaller mutation value had relatively longer chromosomes eg m=9 vs m=0.01

## Reflection

Please provide a reflection on your experience with this assignment-- what was interesting? what was hard? what do you feel like you learned?

Throughout this assignment, I got to further observe the tiny issues which might affect the final overall performance. Also, it was a good practice on how to make various decisions regarding the memory use.
